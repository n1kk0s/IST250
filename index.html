    <h1>L05 Questions</h1>
    <p>Question 1:
        
        The hsl() property is a color property made up of hue, saturation, and lightness. It is used the same way as any other color: By adding color: hsl(0, 0%,0%). If I were coloring a second level heading tag dark purple I would use color: hsl(290, 60%, 40%) to provide the purple hue, a medium saturation, and a little black to my purple to make it darker.
        
        
        
        Question 2:
        
        To edit the alpha layer of a div, you will have to add opacity to the div's styles. Adding opacity with a percentage will change how opaque the div and it's contents are with 0 being transparent and 100 being opaque. If there is anything inside the div, including text, the opacity of the content will also be affected by the opacity of the div that it's in. (A workaround for a translucent background could be making the background less opaque in Photoshop and saving as a png file)

        Explain the positioning context, also known as the containing element. This concept is critical when positioning in CSS. In a couple of sentences explain the basic idea when considering position: absolute. (5 pts.)
        Chapter 16 in the textbook covers several options considering web page or screen layouts with many combinations of fixed widths, fluid widths, elastic options, single columns, multi-columns, or hybrids of all of the above. Think of a web scenario (like, say, an online newspaper, or a stock reporting business, for example) and then match it with one of these layout models (or any combination thereof) that you think would be a good match. Think about what type of content this scenario would require on their site. In a couple of sentences, explain why you think this model would be a good match for your scenario. (5 pts.)</p>
