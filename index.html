            I'm still trying to find a topic for the content of this site, so I'll </br>
            just add some of the requirements here with some content that may make </br>
            into the final site.

    <h3>Just so you know I'm not slacking...</h3>
    <p>
        Check out the site that I've been working on with a local business! </br>
        This started as a small project for my English 202D course last semester, <br>
        but the owners and I decided to do a complete design overhaul of their website. <br>
        I think the current website is insanely dated, but go ahead and <a href="http://www.super322drive-in.com" target="_blank">see for yourself</a>. <br>
        <br>
        <img style="width: 200px; height: auto;" src="images/322logo.png" alt="Super 322 Drive-In Logo">
        <br>
        <a href="http://nickweld.com/NewSuper322" target="_blank">Welcome to the new Super 322 Drive-In website!</a><br>
        A friend of mine who's a graphic designer helped me come up with a fresh<br>
        new logo and heading style for the site. We decided to implement it using<br>
        Bootstrap to make the site slightly more responsive, since we were both<br>
        inexperienced with responsive web design. This is still a work in progress<br>
        but we're learning a lot from it and it looks loads better in comparison<br>
        to the old site.
